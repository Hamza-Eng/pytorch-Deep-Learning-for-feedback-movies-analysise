## Good Review:

**Movie:** Parasite (2019)

This darkly comedic thriller is a masterpiece of suspense and social commentary. Director Bong Joon-ho crafts a story that keeps you guessing until the very end, all while brilliantly critiquing class disparity. The performances are phenomenal, especially from the lead actors Song Kang-ho and Choi Woo-shik. Parasite is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates intelligent and thought-provoking filmmaking.

**Movie:** Spirited Away (2001)

Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant animated film. It tells the story of Chihiro, a young girl who enters the spirit world and must work in a bathhouse for witches to free her parents. The film is full of wonder and imagination, exploring themes of courage, self-discovery, and the importance of family.

## Bad Review:

**Movie:** The Room (2003)

Tommy Wiseau's The Room is a cult classic, but for all the wrong reasons. Often considered one of the worst movies ever made, The Room is filled with nonsensical dialogue, awkward acting, and bizarre directing choices. While some find humor in its sheer awfulness, others will likely find it tedious and frustrating.

**Movie:**  **Zoolander 2 (2016)**

Zoolander 2 is a disappointing sequel that fails to capture the magic of the original film. The jokes are mostly stale and uninspired, and the plot feels forced. While Ben Stiller remains charming as Derek Zoolander, the rest of the cast seems to be phoning it in. Overall, Zoolander 2 is a forgettable comedy that is best avoided.
